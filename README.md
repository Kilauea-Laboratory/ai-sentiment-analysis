## AI Sentiment Analysis on Reddit Discussions
</p>

Background:
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on accurately classifying AI-related discussions on Reddit into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The main objectives of the project were to conduct a comparative analysis of various machine learning models and to explore sentiment trends over time within these discussions. To achieve these goals, a combination of conventional machine learning techniques and an LSTM model were employed.

The project's key achievements include:

Implementing a comprehensive sentiment analysis framework for AI-related Reddit discussions.
Utilizing Scikit-Learn, Keras, VADER, and LSTM for building and training sentiment classification models.
Conducting a thorough comparative analysis of different machine learning models to determine their effectiveness in sentiment classification.
Exploring and visualizing sentiment trends over time to gain insights into how sentiments have evolved in AI-related discussions.
Model Performance:
Two notable models were developed and evaluated:

Combined CNN + LSTM Model: Achieved an impressive F1 Score of 0.839.
Linear SVC Model: Achieved a competitive F1 Score of 0.82.
Technologies Used and Skills Applied:
The project leveraged a range of technologies and skills, including but not limited to:

Scikit-Learn: Used for building machine learning models and conducting analysis.
Keras: Employed to construct and train the LSTM model for sentiment classification.
VADER: Used for the sentiment analysis of textual data.
Long Short-term Memory (LSTM): A type of recurrent neural network well-suited for sequence-based tasks.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques applied to process and understand human language data.
Python (Programming Language): The primary language used for coding and implementation.
