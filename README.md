### Background:
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on accurately classifying AI-related discussions on Reddit into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The main objectives of the project were to conduct a comparative analysis of various machine learning models and to explore sentiment trends over time within these discussions. To achieve these goals, a combination of conventional machine learning techniques and an LSTM model were employed.

The project's key achievements include:

- Implementing a comprehensive sentiment analysis framework for AI-related Reddit discussions.
- Utilizing Scikit-Learn, Keras, VADER, and LSTM for building and training sentiment classification models.
- Conducting a thorough comparative analysis of different machine learning models to determine their effectiveness in sentiment classification.
- Exploring and visualizing sentiment trends over time to gain insights into how sentiments have evolved in AI-related discussions.

### Model Performance:
Two notable models were developed and evaluated:
Combined CNN + LSTM Model: Achieved an impressive F1 Score of 0.839.
Linear SVC Model: Achieved a competitive F1 Score of 0.82.

### Technologies Used and Skills Applied:
The project leveraged a range of technologies and skills, including but not limited to:
- Scikit-Learn: Used for building machine learning models and conducting analysis.
- Keras: Employed to construct and train the LSTM model for sentiment classification.
- VADER: Used for the sentiment analysis of textual data.
- Long Short-term Memory (LSTM): A type of recurrent neural network well-suited for sequence-based tasks.
